# Blockchain Platform Comparison and Analysis

A repository to document the analysis and comparison of different blockchain platform types based on their technical features and ideal use cases.

## The Task

The objective of this project is to analyze and compare three types of blockchain platforms: Public, Private, and Consortium.

The core requirements are:

1.  **Select one platform** from each of the three categories.
2.  **Create a comparison table** detailing the technical features of the selected platforms.
3.  **Write a short report** that compares the platforms and provides a justified recommendation for each of the following use cases:
    * A decentralized app.
    * A supply chain network among known partners.
    * An inter-bank financial application.

**The complete analysis and report can be found in the Word document located in the `repository`.**
